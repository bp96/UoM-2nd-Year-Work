# UoM-2nd-Year-Work

Final projects code during Semester 1 of 2nd year at the University of Manchester have been uploaded here. These two projects are the following:

1. Python: PythonCode.py
Filters through a list of the most populous towns and cities in the UK and produces a visualisation whereby the size of the circles are proportional to the populations within that area. NOTE: requires GBmap.jpg, GBplaces.csv and produces output GBplaces_visualised.jpg
  
2. C++: CPlusPlusCode.cpp
Code uses the hill-climbing optimisation algorithm to find the shortest distance to travel to the top 100 most populous places in the UK. The code also identifies the optimal coordinates where the distance required is minimised, and establishes what the nearest city is. NOTE: requires GBplaces.csv
